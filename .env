# Store your Turnstile secret in environment variables, never in source code.
# Recommended approaches:
#
# 1) Local development:
#    - Create a .env file containing: TURNSTILE_SECRET=your-secret-here
#    - Ensure .env is listed in .gitignore so it is not committed to GitHub.
#    - Commit a .env.example file with TURNSTILE_SECRET= (empty) to document required vars.
#
# 2) Production:
#    - Use your platform's secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault,
#      GCP Secret Manager, Vercel/Netlify/Render/Heroku "Environment Variables/Secrets").
#    - Set TURNSTILE_SECRET in the deployment environment configuration, not in code.
#
# 3) CI/CD:
#    - Configure TURNSTILE_SECRET as a repository/organization secret in your CI system
#      (e.g., GitHub Actions -> Settings -> Secrets and variables).
#    - Pass it to build/deploy steps via environment variables.
#
# Additional safeguards:
#    - Audit for accidental commits: use secret-scanning tools (GitHub secret scanning,
#      truffleHog, gitleaks).
#    - Validate gitignore: ensure .env and any config files with secrets are ignored.
#    - Avoid hardcoding secrets in config files, test fixtures, or logs.
#    - Rotate secrets periodically and on any suspected exposure.
#
# Usage in code:
#    - Read from process.env.TURNSTILE_SECRET (Node), or the equivalent in your runtime.
#    - Fail fast if the variable is missing to prevent insecure runs.
#
# Env var name:
#    - TURNSTILE_SECRET
